name: ctrl
description: Build on-chain automation workflows on Base or Ethereum via the CTRL MCP. Use for recurring/triggered/scheduled actions (DCA, price-triggered swaps, launchpad sniping, whale watching) that should run autonomously after a single user signature. The wallet signs once; the CTRL keeper executes every trigger after.

# CTRL: Visual Workflow Automation for DeFi

## Overview

CTRL is a workflow automation platform for on-chain actions. Users compose **trigger → action → condition** graphs in a visual builder; an audited V3 vault enforces per-swap and per-day spending caps; a Render-hosted keeper polls every ~5 seconds and executes when conditions are met. The user signs **once** to deploy the vault + register rules, and everything else runs autonomously under on-chain limits they pre-authorized.

Two integration pathways:

1. **REST API** — direct HTTP, **no API key required**. Recommended for wallet-native clients where the agent has access to the user's wallet.
2. **Streamable MCP server** at `https://ctrl.build/api/mcp` — JSON-RPC, requires `Bearer sk_ctrl_...`. Used by Cursor / Claude Desktop.

The REST path is anonymous-friendly because the security boundary is the wallet signature at activate-time, not an API key at create-time. The first wallet to sign the EIP-5792 activation batch becomes the workflow's owner. Drafts that never get activated are auto-pruned.

## Trust boundary

- **The user's wallet signs.** Vault activation is an EIP-5792 `transactions[]` batch — one user signature deploys the V13 vault and registers the spending rules. The wallet's confirmation UI is the source of intent; agents never hold keys.
- **CTRL executes.** After the signature lands, the keeper takes over forever. Every execution is bounded by the `maxPerSwap` and `maxPerDay` caps the user signed.

The natural agent flow:

1. User says "DCA 0.01 ETH into USDC every Monday at 14:00 UTC."
2. Agent calls `ctrl_get_block_catalog` to discover the right block ids.
3. Agent calls `ctrl_create_workflow` with the trigger + action chain.
4. Agent calls `ctrl_activate` — gets back a `transactions[]` batch.
5. Agent hands the batch to the user's wallet (via `send_calls` / `send_prepared_calls` / Base Account / any EIP-5792-capable wallet). User confirms in the wallet popup.
6. Keeper picks up on the next 5-second tick.

## Getting Started

### For wallet-native agents — zero setup

Add `ctrl.build` to your client's web-request allowlist (if it has one) and you're done. No API keys, no env vars, no minting flow. The agent invokes CTRL REST endpoints directly; the user's wallet handles the signature at activate-time, which is what binds the workflow.

### For Cursor / Claude Desktop (optional, advanced)

If you want to call the JSON-RPC MCP server instead of REST:

```json
{
  "ctrl": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://ctrl.build/api/mcp",
             "--header", "Authorization:Bearer ${CTRL_API_KEY}"],
    "env": { "CTRL_API_KEY": "sk_ctrl_..." }
  }
}
```

## Core MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ctrl_get_vault_status` | Read the user's vault address, ETH + WETH balance, active rules. Call **before** activate so you can tell the user how much to fund. |
| `ctrl_get_block_catalog` | Return the live catalog of every block (trigger / action / condition / utility) with config-field schemas. Pass `chain` to filter to chain-compatible blocks. |
| `ctrl_create_workflow` | Create a workflow draft. One trigger + up to 20 actions/conditions/utilities. Returns `{ workflowId, activateUrl }`. |
| `ctrl_activate` | Encode the EIP-5792 `transactions[]` batch the user signs once. Returns calls + chainId for the wallet's `send_calls`-style handoff. |
| `ctrl_fire_manual` | Manually fire a workflow once. Keeper picks up within ~5s. Use to test without waiting for the natural trigger. |
| `ctrl_get_execution_logs` | Read recent executions: trigger, status, BaseScan/Etherscan tx hash, gas, timing. |

## Available Blocks

CTRL exposes 23 blocks via `GET /api/mcp/block-catalog` across four categories. Always call this first — every key in `trigger.config` and `chain[].config` must match catalog `fields[].key` exactly.

**Triggers (9)** — `time.interval`, `trigger.manual`, `price.above`, `price.below`, `price.change`, `pool.created` (Base launchpads: Clanker / Flaunch / Zora / BANKR), `watch.whale`, `event.transfer`, `event.balance`

**Actions (5)** — `cypher.swap`, `read.balance`, `notify.telegram`, `notify.discord`, `util.webhook`

**Conditions (4)** — `cond.price`, `cond.balance`, `cond.allowed_weekdays`, `cond.time_window`

**Utilities (5)** — `util.delay`, `util.note`, `util.log`, `util.stop`, `util.snapshot`

## Chain Selection

`ctrl_create_workflow` accepts `targetChain: "base" | "ethereum"`. Default is `base`.

- **Base mainnet** — launchpads (`pool.created`), Aerodrome routing, UniV4 hooks. Lowest fees.
- **Ethereum mainnet** — UniV3 routing only. No launchpads (`pool.created` returns 400 if `targetChain="ethereum"`). Tighter mainnet fee caps.

Activation deeplinks resolve to the correct chain automatically — the workflow row carries `chain` and `network`, the encoder reads them.

## REST API (anonymous, no key)

```bash
# 1. Create a workflow — NO auth header. The row is anonymous until claimed
#    at activate-time by the signing wallet.
curl -X POST https://ctrl.build/api/mcp/workflows \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "DCA ETH→USDC weekly",
    "workflow_data": { "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] },
    "chain": "base",
    "network": "mainnet"
  }'
# → { "workflow": { "id": "<uuid>", "name": "...", "status": "draft", "created_at": "..." } }

# 2. Encode the activation batch — pass the user's wallet via headers
#    (X-Wallet-Address + a signature from the user's wallet).
curl -X POST https://ctrl.build/api/mcp/activate/<workflowId> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Wallet-Address: 0x..." \
  -H "X-Wallet-Signature: 0x..." \
  -d '{ "maxPerSwapEth": "0.01", "maxPerDayEth": "0.1", "depositEth": "0.05" }'
# → { "calls": [...], "chainId": 8453, "vaultAddress": "0x..." }

# 3. Hand the calls + chainId directly to the user's wallet via its
#    EIP-5792 send_calls / send_prepared_calls flow.

# 4. Read public state — vault status by wallet, no auth needed:
curl "https://ctrl.build/api/mcp/vault-status?wallet=0x..."

# 5. Read execution logs by workflow id (public — anyone with the id can see):
curl "https://ctrl.build/api/mcp/execution-logs?workflow_id=<id>"
```

The wallet signature in step 2 is what binds the workflow to the user. First signer wins; subsequent activate calls from other wallets get `403`.

## Rate Limits

All limits are per source IP, enforced via a Supabase-backed counter so they're shared across every serverless instance.

- **`POST /api/mcp/workflows`** (create) — 10 per 10 minutes
- **`POST /api/mcp/activate/<id>`** (prepare activation batch) — 5 per 10 minutes
- **`GET /api/mcp/vault-status`** — 60 per minute
- **`GET /api/mcp/execution-logs`** — 60 per minute
- **`GET /api/mcp/block-catalog`** — unrestricted (cached, cheap)

`429` responses carry `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers.

## Security Architecture

CTRL implements a **vault-direct model** — no session keys, no agent-held credentials:

**On-chain caps** — Every rule the user signs carries an immutable `maxPerSwap` and `maxPerDay`. The vault enforces them; no off-chain check can be bypassed.

**Kill switches** — `pauseVault()` halts all execution; `revokeRule(ruleId)` kills a single workflow. Both are 1-tx, user-callable any time.

**Built-in safety primitives** — The `pool.created` trigger has a `safetyEnabled` flag that runs GoPlus honeypot + tax + score checks before any swap fires. Honeypots and high-tax tokens are auto-rejected without an execution log entry.

**Keeper bounded** — The 8-wallet keeper fleet can only call methods the vault permits. Compromising a keeper wallet costs at most one tick's per-swap cap, not the vault.

## Example Flows

### DCA ETH → USDC every Monday 14:00 UTC

```
trigger: time.interval (everyMinutes=10080, alignedTo="monday-14:00-utc")
action:  cypher.swap (tokenIn="ETH", tokenOut="USDC", amount="0.01", slippage=5)
```

### Snipe Flaunch launches with "milady" in the name, max 0.005 ETH, sell at 2x

```
trigger: pool.created (launchpad=["flaunch"], keywordIncludes="milady",
                       safetyEnabled=true, safetyMinScore=50)
action:  cypher.swap (tokenIn="ETH", tokenOut="{{trigger.tokenAddress}}",
                      tokenOutMode="dynamic", amount="0.005", slippage=15,
                      autoSellEnabled=true, autoSellMode="multiple",
                      autoSellMultiplier=2, autoSellPercent=100,
                      autoSellReceiveToken="USDC")
action:  notify.telegram (message="bought {{token}}, sell-at-2x armed")
```

### Sell 50% of $PEPE if price drops 20%

```
trigger: price.change (token="PEPE", changePercent=-20, window="1h")
action:  cypher.swap (tokenIn="PEPE", tokenOut="USDC",
                      amountMode="percent", amountPercent=50, slippage=10)
```

## What the Agent Will NOT Do

- Hold private keys. Activation always returns an unsigned batch the user signs in their own wallet.
- Widen caps without re-prompting. `maxPerSwap` and `maxPerDay` changes require a new signature.
- Execute on a chain the user didn't pick. `targetChain` is mandatory at create-time.
- Override safety flags. `safetyEnabled: false` requires an explicit user confirmation in the create flow.
